# Lesson 0 — Setting up Replit

We'll use [replit.com](https://replit.com) to run our code. Replit is a free online compiler that works with hundreds of languages, including the one we're using, Python!

## Signing up for an account

Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com). You should see something like this:

Click the blue button that says "Sign up", in the top right corner. Sign up for an account with a new username and password. You can also use Google or Facebook to sign in.

## Creating a new Repl
Repls (pronounced "repple") are files you can run on Replit. We create a new Repl to write our Python code and run it.

Now that you've created your account, the Replit homepage should look like this. Click on the blue button in the top left corner that says "+ Create".

You should see a popup that looks like this. From the list, select the option that says "Python". In the field that says "Name your repl", type in a name. Once you're done, click the blue button that says "+ Create Repl"

You should be brought to this page. You can now start writing code in the upper box! When you're done, press the green "Run" button, and your output will be shown in the lower box. The lower box is called the "console", and it's where input and output are displayed.

Try typing this code into the upper box, and run it to see what happens!

```Python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If you see `Hello, world!` in the console, hooray! You just wrote your first Python program.

Over the next few lessons, we'll dive into the magical world of programming! Replit will become your friend.

Remember, what you're learning is *Python*; Replit is just a website that we use to run our Python files. There are thousands of ways to run Python, but this is one of the simplest. No matter what you're using to run Python, the code itself never changes. We could be speaking English in Singapore, the US, or China, but we'll still be speaking English!

## Seeing your old Repls
All your Repls are saved. In the sidebar, click "My Repls" to see all your past files. They might be in the folder called "Unnamed Repls" if you didn't change the default name when creating a new Repl.
