# A quadratic equation may be expressed in terms of `ax² + bx + c = 0`, where
# `a`, `b` and `c` are constants, and `a` is non-zero.

# Write a program that takes in the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints the
# two roots of the equation, assuming that the roots are real. (Hint: do you
# remember lower sec math?)


# We'll put the solution here in a while. Try it yourself first!
