# Lesson 2 — Operators

## Introduction
In the previous lesson, we learned about the basic building blocks of programs — variables. Variables are like labelled boxes that store values. We can mention the values contained in each box using their labels; more accurately, we refer to variables using their variable names. [Here are the notes from Lesson 1 if you need a refresh.](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%201)

While variables can be useful on their own, they become so much more powerful when we manipulate them and make them interact with each other. We saw a brief example of this last week: using `+-*/` to add, subtract, multiply, and divide values. These are examples of operators — we use them to _operate_ on values. Today, you'll discover that there's so much more to operators than those four!

Python has three categories of operators: mathematical, comparison, and logic. Let's dive in!

## Mathematical operators
Mathematical operators are exactly what they sound like — math. Here are the ones we'll be looking at:

* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You're already familiar with these.
* `//`: floor division, a special type of division that always gives you integers.
* `%`: modulo, which gives you the remainder after dividing.
* `**`: exponentiate, which lets you calculate powers.

We'll first understand what the three new operators (`//`, `%`, and `**`) do, then we'll look at some examples of how we can use them.

### `//` (floor division)
Let's try to evaluate `25 / 10`. The standard division operator, `/`, will give us a floating-point number (non-whole number): `2.5`. [(If you need a recap of data types...)](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%201#data-types)

Sometimes, we want an integer result instead. This is where the floor division, `//`, operator comes in.

```Python
print(25 // 10)
print(39 // 10)
print(2 // 3)
```

```
> 2
> 3
> 0
```

Notice that `//` always rounds _down_ to the nearest integer.

### `%` (modulo)
In primary school, we learned that `7 ÷ 3` gives us a _quotient_ of `2` and a _remainder_ of `1`; i.e. `7 = 3 × 2 + 1`.

`%` doesn't have anything to do with percentages! In Python, it's the _modulo_ operator — it tells us the _remainder_ after a division.

```Python
print(7 % 3)
print(8 % 4)
```

```
> 1
> 0
```

### `**` (exponentiation)
What's the volume of a cube whose sides are 5m? In math, we'd calculate that with `5³`, which is `5 × 5 × 5`.

In Python, we'd represent `5³` with `5 ** 3`. `**` is the exponential operator!

```Python
print(5 ** 3)
print(0.5 ** 2)
```

```
> 125
> 0.25
```

### More examples with operators
Let's see how we can use operators to solve some real life problems!

We can use `+-*/` for simple operations. Let's use Python to help us run a hot chocolate stall.

```Python
cups_in_stock = 25        # I have 25 cups of hot chocolate left.
price_per_cup = 1.5       # Each cup costs $1.50

# A customer comes.
cups_bought = 4          # The customer asks for 4 cups of hot chocolate.

total_price = cups_bought * price_per_cup
cups_in_stock = cups_in_stock - cups_bought

print("For", cups_bought, "cups of hot chocolate, you need to pay", total_price, "dollars.")
print("I now have", cups_in_stock, "cups of hot chocolate left.")
```

```
> For 4 cups of hot chocolate, you need to pay 6.0 dollars.
> I now have 21 cups of hot chocolate left.
```

At our hot chocolate stall, we have a microwave to heat up our milk. But our microwave only displays seconds! Let's convert it to minutes and seconds.

```Python
total_seconds_remaining = 415    # Total time remaining in seconds

min = seconds_remaining // 60    # Remember that 1 minute is 60 seconds
sec = seconds_remaining % 60

print("Time remaining:", min, "minutes and", sec, "seconds.")
```

```
> Time remaining: 6 minutes and 55 seconds.
```

## Comparison operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They give us either `True` or `False`.

Python comparison operators are just like math! Here's a handy table to help you remember:

| Math | Python | Description | Example |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| =    | `==`   | equal to    | `1 + 2 == 3` |
| ≠    | `!=`   | not equal to | `2 - 1 != 5` |
| >    | `>`    | greater than | `5 > 2` |
| ≥    | `>=`   | greater than or equal to | `5 > 2`, `3 >= 3` |
| <    | `<`    | less than | `1 < 3` |
| ≤    | `<=`   | less than or equal to | `1 < 3`, `3 <= 3` |

Printing the result of a comparison will only give us one of two possible values, `True` or `False`.

```Python
print(5 > 2)
print(8 <= (16 / 2))
print(3 == 4)
print(3 != 4)
print(4 != 4)
```

```
> True
> True
> False
> True
> False
```

We can also use the `==` and `!=` operators to compare strings.

```Python
print("Hello" == "Hi")
print("One" != "Two")
```

```
> False
> True
```

**Important**: The comparison operator `==` and the assignment operator `=` are not the same. Can you explain their differences?

## Logical Operators
Logical operators help us evaluate combinations of boolean (`True` or `False`) values.

There are three main logical operators:
* `or` gives `True` only if either value is `True`.
* `and` gives `True` only if both values are `True`.
* `not` simply inverses the value — `True` becomes `False`, and `False` becomes `True`.

### `or`
The `or` operator tests two boolean values. If _either_ of the tests are `True`, then the result of `or` is `True`. Only if _both_ of the tests return a result of `False` will `or` give a result of `False`.

| Expression | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `True or True` | `True` |
| `True or False` | `True` |
| `False or True` | `True` |
| `False or False` | `False` |

I like shopping online! If I need new shoes, I'll go and buy a pair online. But if I see a discount, I'll still buy a pair even if I don't need them. In other words, if I need new shoes, _or_ they're on discount, I'll buy them.

Let's write a Python program to help me decide if I'm buying new shoes!

```Python
need_new_shoes = False
on_discount = True

will_buy_shoes = need_new_shoes or on_discount
print("Will I buy new shoes?", will_buy_shoes)
```

```
> Will I buy new shoes? True
```

### `and`
If _both_ the tests are `True`, then `and` gives `True`. However, if _either_ of the tests are `False`, then `and` gives a result of `False`.

| Expression | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `True and True` | `True` |
| `True and False` | `False` |
| `False and True` | `False` |
| `False and False` | `False` |

My parents have scolded me for my online shopping habits 🙁. Now, they say I can only buy new shoes if I need them _and_ they're also on discount! Let's change our previous Python program a little bit.

```Python
need_new_shoes = False
on_discount = True

will_buy_shoes = need_new_shoes and on_discount
print("Will I buy new shoes?", will_buy_shoes)
```

```
> Will I buy new shoes? False
```

### `not`
Unlike `and` and `or`, `not` acts only on a single boolean value. It simply inverses it — `True` becomes `False`, and `False` becomes `True`.

| Expression | Result |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `not True` | `False` |
| `not False` | `True` |

My parents have softened up a bit. Now they say that if I didn't buy any shoes, I can go and buy a jacket!

```Python
bought_shoes = False

will_buy_jacket = not bought_shoes
print("Will I buy a new jacket?", will_buy_jacket)
```

```
> Will I buy a new jacket? True
```

## More examples
Just like in math, we can use brackets to specify the order of operations.

```Python
price_of_drink = 1.2
price_of_burger = 4.5

number_of_sets_ordered = 5

total_price = (1.2 + 4.5) * 5
print("Total price is", total_price)
```

```
> Total price is 28.5
```

We even combine multiple operators together!

```Python
number_of_sets_ordered = 5
total_price = 28.5

money_in_wallet = 30
number_of_friends = 6

should_buy_meal = total_price <= money_in_wallet and number_of_friends == number_of_sets_ordered
print("Should I buy the meal?", should_buy_meal)
```

```
> Should I buy the meal? False
```

## Let's practise
Write a program that takes in a temperature in fahrenheit, converts it to celsius, then prints the result. (Hint: you'll need to search for the conversion formula.)

You're the inventory manager for a warehouse that supplies soft drinks. You have a fixed number of cases of drinks in your stock. Each case costs $15. To cover delivery costs, the minimum order amount must be at least $100.

Write a program that helps you evaluate new orders. Your program should take in the number of cases ordered, then decide if you should accept the order using the conditions above. Print out: whether you're accepting the order, the amount of money you should receive, and how much stock you'll have left after fulfilling the order.

[**Solution**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/blob/main/Lesson%202/warehouse_inventory_1.py)

A quadratic equation may be expressed in terms of `ax² + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b` and `c` are constants, and `a` is non-zero.

Write a program that takes in the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints the two roots of the equation, assuming that the roots are real. (Hint: do you remember lower sec math?)

[**Solution**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/blob/main/Lesson%202/quadratic_roots.py)

---

`xor` is another useful logical operator that gives `True` only if exactly one of the two boolean values are `True`, but not both.

| Expression        | Result  |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| `True xor True`   | `False` |
| `True xor False`  | `True`  |
| `False xor True`  | `True`  |
| `False xor False` | `False` |

Unfortunately, Python doesn't have a built-in `xor` operator, so you can't simply type `True xor False` in Python.

Write some code using the other logic operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to get the same result as `xor` would give you. Test your code using the 4 examples in the table above.

[**Solution**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/blob/main/Lesson%202/xor_operator.py)

## Conclusion
Operators let us manipulate data and variables. There are three types of operators: mathematical, comparison, and logical.

In the next lesson, you'll see how we can further use these operators to make our code adapt to different scenarios!
