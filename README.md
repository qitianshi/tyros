# Python resources by Project Tyros
Coding for all.

## Hello!
This is a compilation of Python resources by Project Tyros, a service learning project by Tew En Hao, Qi Tianshi, Brian Hu, Neo Souw Chuan, and Wong Zenwei from Hwa Chong Institution. We're bringing computing to all ages with simple lessons in Scratch and Python!

## What's here
Here you'll find resources from all past Python lessons. Above this file you'll see folders for each session. Click on one to see notes, example code, and more.

What we've covered so far:
* [**Lesson 0**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%200): setting up Replit
* [**Lesson 1**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%201): input/output, comments, and variables
* [**Lesson 2**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%202): operators
* [**Lesson 3**](https://github.com/qitianshi/tyros-resources/tree/main/Lesson%203): If/else statements
